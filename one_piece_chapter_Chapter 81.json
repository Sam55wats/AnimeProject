  "long_summary": "On the Marine ship docked outside Cocoyasi Village, Nezumi gleefully examines the money he stole from Nami, laughing at her stupidity to work for Arlong for her freedom this long. Meanwhile, Nami confronts Arlong in Arlong Park over her money being stolen, and Arlong acts as though Nezumi stealing it was out of his control, saying Nami will\u00a0just have to start saving 100,000,000 again from scratch. He reminds her that if she tries to run away, he will kill the residents of Cocoyasi Village, and Nami remembers Genzo telling her that they had kept this threat secret to her in case she wanted to run away. Nami breaks free\u00a0and runs out\u00a0of Arlong Park, followed by Arlong's jeering.\u00a0Back in\u00a0Cocoyasi Village, a furious Genzo tells the\u00a0villagers to prepare to take up arms and fight the Arlong Pirates, while\u00a0Nami is desperately running back to\u00a0stop\u00a0them, as she knows they'll die if they fight, and that would be the end of everything. Genzo tells the villagers that they promised each other eight years ago that they would endure the fish-men's cruelty as long as it took for Nami to buy back the village, but they can no longer keep living under these conditions if Arlong has no intention of ever letting them go. However, he shouts that they'll\u00a0never forgive the fish-men\u00a0for toying around with Nami's good heart, and all the villagers agree with him, stating that they are more than ready to fight, and have been for eight years. However, Nami reaches them and tries to assure them that she is readily willing to save up the money again, even saying it would be easier this time. The villagers are shocked and deeply moved by her efforts.\u00a0In Arlong Park, Chew laughingly comments that Arlong can be pretty heartless, with Arlong replying that he's not just going to let a navigator of Nami's ability get away from him.\u00a0However\u00a0Arlong replies he isn't completely heartless and\u00a0that he will let Nami go eventually, but only after she has made a map of the entire world, as he and the other fish-men roar with laughter upon realizing that will take decades.\nMeanwhile, Genzo does not listen to Nami's assurances, telling her that she knows it would be in vain.\u00a0He embraces her,\u00a0commending her for the efforts she has made to liberate them, which\u00a0almost moves Nami to tears.\u00a0Genzo then\u00a0tells\u00a0her to\u00a0leave the village, and\u00a0Nojiko backs him up, encouraging her sister to go and pursue her dream. Now desperate,\u00a0Nami pulls out a dagger, declaring that she does not wish to see any of them hurt again, and telling them they'll die, but Genzo displays his dedication\u00a0by grabbing the dagger, cutting his hand in the process, and the villagers say their hearts are set. Genzo shouts at Nami to get out of the way, and the villagers race past her toward Arlong Park, declaring their will to fight even if it is likely they will lose,\u00a0leaving Nami kneeling in the middle of the street.\u00a0Driven to her breaking point by rage, grief and despair, Nami grabs the dagger and begins to psychotically\u00a0stab herself in the shoulder where her tattoo is, repeatedly screaming Arlong's name as tears run down her face. However, Luffy comes and grabs Nami's arm before she can harm herself further. Keeping her back to him, Nami tells Luffy that he doesn't know anything about what's happening here,\u00a0and that she already told him\u00a0to leave the island because this has nothing to do with him, throwing a few handfuls of dirt in his direction. Luffy acknowledges both these points, but he doesn't move or say anything further.\u00a0Nami finally\u00a0breaks down in tears, turns to face Luffy, and\u00a0begs him to help her. Luffy responds by silently putting his straw hat on her head, before he walks\u00a0forward and declares extremely loudly that he will help. Nami is shocked to have the straw hat on her head, knowing Luffy's attachment to it, and is moved to fresh tears, as well as when she watches\u00a0Luffy walk\u00a0toward the rest of his crewmates, who were waiting just ahead and tells them to come with him, to which they immediately\u00a0agree. Meanwhile, the villagers have reached Arlong Park, only to find a battered and bloodied\u00a0Johnny and Yosaku sitting in front of the gate. The pair mentions how they heard Nami's backstory from the woods, and ashamed at having doubted her character, went to confront the Arlong Pirates, but were\u00a0defeated.\u00a0The two bounty hunters do not intend to let\u00a0the villagers pass them, as they\u00a0have no chance of winning, and instead are waiting for another group of men, to the villagers' confusion. Inside Arlong Park, Arlong wonders\u00a0if Johnny and Yosaku were part of Zoro's crew, and Kuroobi doubts it, saying they were too weak for that. Just\u00a0then, Luffy punches the gate off its hinges and asks which of the fish-men is Arlong, much to Arlong's shock and chagrin.\n\n"
