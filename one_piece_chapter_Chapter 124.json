Valentine. They explain that Luffy is under the spell of Color Trap, where she can influence the behavior of a victim based on the colors she draws on them, before attacking the duo. Usopp and Karoo try to escape, while Vivi realizes that Luffy's lethargic attitude must be due to of Miss Goldenweek, who explains her \"color trap\" ability.\nVivi then tricks Luffy into stepping out of the trap which returns Luffy to normal.

Mr. 5 reveals a new weapon: a .44 revolver that can shoot 6 bullets at the same time.\nHowever, instead of trying to help himself, Usopp fires at Luffy destroying his shirt and freeing him from color trap once more.
