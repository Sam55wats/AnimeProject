  "long_summary": "After Luffy finds a box of cannonballs onboard, he and Usopp decide to play with the ship's cannons. As they do so, Zoro takes a nap, where he dreams about his childhood.\nZoro was a dojoyaburi at Shimotsuki Village, challenging local dojos to duels. However, after challenging the dojo of Koushirou, he faced defeat at the hands of Koushirou's daughter, Kuina, and as promised had to join the dojo as a student. After training much more rigorously than his peers, he became strong enough to defeat the adults at the dojo, but was still unable to defeat Kuina.\nOne day, Zoro challenged Kuina to a duel using real swords as opposed to shinai. Kuina defeated Zoro for the two-thousandth time. However, she lamented she would never become a powerful swordfighter as she was a woman. Zoro and Kuina promised to each other to train harder and become stronger, and one of them would become the world's greatest swordsman.\nBoth kept their promises and increased their training efforts, but Kuina tragically suffered a fatal fall down a flight of stairs. With Kuina deceased, Zoro decided he had to become the world's greatest swordsman to honor his promise. Koushirou entrusted Zoro with Kuina's prized heirloom katana, the Wado Ichimonji, for him to further his training. Zoro would train for another eight years before leaving the dojo to become a pirate hunter.\nBack in the present day, Luffy fires the cannon at a distant rock. They then go to the kitchen, but they find themselves raided by Johnny, Zoro's old friend. Johnny accuses the crew of attempting to kill his friend.\n"
