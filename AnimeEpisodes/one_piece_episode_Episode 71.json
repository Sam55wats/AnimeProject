  "long_summary": "As Nami and Usopp see someone gigantic approximating the Going Merry through breaking trees across the forest, they start crying. A giant comes out and asks Nami and Usopp for alcohol. Nami respond that the only alcohol they have is for cooking and disinfection. The giant screams in pain because he just got bitten by a T. rex from the back. He chops the T. rex head and introduces himself as Brogy, claiming to be the strongest warrior of Elbaf. He also calls Nami and Usopp as guests but, frightened, the two play dead.\nElsewhere, Luffy and Vivi are exploring. Luffy comments the view on top of the Brachiosaurus and says he wants to have lunch in there. Luffy then starts to play along the necks of the Brachiosaurus and gets eaten by one of them. A giant slashes the neck of the dinosaur and catches Luffy with his hand and tells him he has been watching him. The giant introduces himself as Dorry, Elbaf's strongest warrior. Luffy introduces himself, Vivi, and Karoo before Dorry invites them to his home.\nBrogy takes Usopp and Nami to his place, where he is roasting dinosaur meat to treat them as his guests. They, however, fearing to be eaten themselves, try to escape through the jungle. Either way, after being chased by larger and larger predators, they end up back at Brogy's feet.\nBack to Dorry, he tells Luffy, Karoo, and Vivi that he is engaged in a duel that has lasted one hundred years. Whenever the island's central volcano erupts, the two face each other in combat.\nMeanwhile in the jungle, Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine join forces with Mr. 3 and Miss Goldenweek, who plot to earn the giants' huge bounties.\n"
