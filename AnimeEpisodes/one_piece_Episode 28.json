  "short_summary": "Gin sacrifices himself to save Luffy from the MH5 gas. Once Luffy and Krieg start battle, Krieg uses his ultimate weapon, the Daisenso.\n",
  "long_summary": "Luffy is left without a means to protect himself from Krieg's MH5 gas. However, Gin decides to give his own mask to Luffy, saving Luffy's life but inhaling the poison himself. He immediately suffers the effects of the poison, causing internal bleeding.\nWhile the restaurant staff rush to care for Gin's condition, Luffy battles Krieg. He penetrates Krieg's defenses and punches through Krieg's Kenzan Mantle, a spiked cape, hitting Krieg in the face.\nAs his ultimate weapon, Krieg uses his armour's pauldrons to form the Daisenso, a spear which creates an explosion upon every impact. To combat this, Luffy punches the Daisenso's spearhead five times in a row, getting caught in the explosion every time, but eventually destroying the spear's head. Zeff admires Luffy for his determination and lack of hesitation.\n",
