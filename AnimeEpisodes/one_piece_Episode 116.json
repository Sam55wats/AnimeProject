Chaka has been convinced and Vivi remembers her time with the crew. \nBack within Chopper's care, Usopp is badly hurt and believed to be dying when Chopper admits he hid the Manju bun so that Usopp couldn\u2019t eat it and now he wants to share half with Usopp. However, this reinvigorates Usopp who is hungry and determined to fight for the entire Manju bun, wide awake and just fine after the battle, punching Chopper away.  \nThe scene cuts back to a panicking Zoro, angry at Nami for not hiding when he warned her to because Mr. 1 and his partner have determined to kill Nami first because the weakest is easier to beat.
