  "long_summary": "Zeff criticizes Krieg for his failed entry into the Grand Line. Krieg recognizes Zeff as a former pirate known for fighting only with his legs, but notes that he had since retired from piracy after losing one of his legs. Believing he only lacked the knowledge needed to traverse the Grand Line, Krieg demands Zeff's old logbook to help him return to the sea. He returns to his ship to give the food to his crew, warning the staff to vacate before he returned.\nGin apologizes on Krieg's behalf, unaware of his plans to betray the Baratie. He explains that the Krieg Pirates' entire armada was defeated by a single man, whom they believe to be the world-famous warrior known as Hawk-Eyes. Of the fifty ships with five thousand crew members, only the flagship containing one hundred warriors survived the attack, partially thanks to a storm which carried it back to East Blue.\nKrieg gives the food to his people, where he explains his intentions to scrap the flagship, seize the Baratie, and return to the Grand Line. He shoots a crew member just for protesting this decision. However, before they are able to initiate their attack, the ship is sliced in half with a single slice, revealing that Hawk-Eyes had followed the Krieg Pirates to the Baratie. The ship sinks and its crew members fall into the sea. They also find Johnny and Yosaku floating in the sea, who reveal that Nami has defected from the crew, taking the ship with her.\n"
