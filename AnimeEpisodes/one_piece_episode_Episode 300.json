  "long_summary": "After many failed attempts, Zoro finally cuts Kaku using his new technique, Asura, after Kaku begins to insult Robin. Shortly afterwards, their fight climaxes, as both combatants use their ultimate techniques. The victor is Zoro. On the other side of the raging waters, on the Bridge of Hesitation, Spandam continues to drag Robin along. Fear strikes her as the end of the bridge, which for her marks the point of no return, comes into sight. She pulls herself free and runs away. Spandam pursues and recaptures her, but she holds on to the rim of the bridge with her teeth. Below them, Franky tries in vain to force his way past the much more powerful Rob Lucci. As Franky is on the verge of being killed, Luffy activates Gear 2 and attacks Lucci, allowing Franky to slip by.\n"
