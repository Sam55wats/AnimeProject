  "title": "Battle with the Giants! Open the Second Door!",
  "short_summary": "In a David and Goliath turn around, the Franky Family and Galley-La Company bring down Kashii. Spandam receives an incomplete report about Monkey D. Luffy and believes that he is no longer a threat. The CP9 members meet with Spandam, except it is more of a comedy routine than a meeting. The Rocketman is ready to enter the island.\n",
  "long_summary": "Even after the Kairiki Destroyers are defeated by Oimo and Kashii, the members of the Franky Family continue fighting the giants. With Mozu and Kiwi's Ship's Bottom Dismantling Cut, Paulie's Rope Action, and Zambai's bazooka, Kashii is finally defeated. He is then nailed down by Peepley Lulu and Tilestone. Oimo then takes on the remaining fighters, while Luffy takes out five hundred soldiers on his own.\nMeanwhile, the members of CP9 meet together in the first full reunion in five years. Fukurou measures the physical strength of the CP9 members. He is shocked to find that Lucci is the strongest, measuring at 4000 doriki (a measurement unit of strength where an average soldier is 10 doriki.) Jabra complains that he was ranked lower than Kaku, and he and Lucci begin bickering.\nAfter the members of CP9 finish fighting, Spandam addresses them. He commends them for capturing Nico Robin and Cutty Flam. He mentions a reward he intends to give them, but does not give it to them at the moment. Meanwhile, Robin reflects on the happy moments she spent with the Straw Hats.\nOutside in the city, Luffy continues being chased by the Marines and World Government, while the Rocketman prepares to arrive at Enies Lobby.\n"
