Nami tries to talk her way out of it but realizes that they will not back down so she runs away.\nUsopp finds Chopper laying on the ground and wakes him up. Chopper tells Usopp that Miss. Merry Christmas ate the Mole Mole Fruit so she is able to go underground and that Mr. 4 is very strong. Usopp and Chopper are left to dodge the bombs that Mr. 4 continues to hit towards them.\n"
