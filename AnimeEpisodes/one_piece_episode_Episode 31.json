  "long_summary": "While at sea, Yosaku reveals Nami's destination: Arlong Park, the base of the most notorious pirate in the East Blue, Arlong. Yosaku suspects Nami is after Arlong's bounty and warns of the dangers that lie ahead since Arlong is a fish-man originating from the Grand Line, so his strength surpasses even that of Krieg. Arlong had previously worked with Jinbe of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, seven government-sanctioned pirates such as Mihawk. Yosaku, Luffy and Sanji go to the galley for lunch.\nNami arrives at Arlong Park, where Arlong makes a bribery with a corrupt Marine officer. She reaches the base and beats a child attempting to eliminate Arlong.\nArriving at the island, Zoro prepares to invade the base, but Usopp and Johnny stop him, tying him with rope and sailing around the island. However, the ship is spotted by resident fish-men. Usopp and Johnny abandon ship, but Zoro is unable to escape the ship, and he is captured by Arlong Pirates. Zoro is interrogated by Arlong, where Arlong claims that fish-men are far superior to humans, as they possess greater strength and can breathe underwater. Nami confronts Zoro, revealing she is an officer and cartographer serving under Arlong.\nJohnny and Usopp arrive onshore at Gosa Village, only to find the entire village had been destroyed, and all houses had been flipped upside-down. A resident fish-man explains that the village was destroyed by the Arlong Pirates' sea monster, Momoo, for protesting against Arlong's reign. Revealing himself to be an Arlong Pirate, he attempts to capture Usopp, but is rescued by a human resident, Nojiko, who diverts the pirate away. They then visit Nojiko's house.\n"
