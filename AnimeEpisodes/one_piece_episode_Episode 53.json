  "long_summary": "After, escaping death by luck, Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji head for the Going Merry, but Buggy and Alvida are in pursuit. Before the duo can take off they are captured by the Marines, but the duo later escape. On the way Tashigi appears and challenges Zoro to a duel for lying to her, Zoro points out that he didn't lie, he just didn't tell her. Nevertheless, Zoro and Tashigi clash swords.\nMeanwhile, Nami and Usopp reach the Going Merry as Mohji was about to burn it down. Before Mohji can properly fight Nami, the Marines catch up and shoot at Mohji. Nami and Usopp take this opportunity board the Going Merry and set sail.\nAt the same time, Luffy and Sanji run into Smoker, who plans to catch Luffy. Sanji goes on, while Luffy and Smoker engage in battle. Luffy's efforts to defeat Smoker are knocked back however and Smoker seemingly defeats him, but a mysterious figure stops Smoker and releases a strong gust of wind, thus giving Luffy time to escape. As Zoro also flees, Sanji reaches the shore, but is surrounded by the marines. After this, Usopp uncharacteristically risks his life by diving into the sea, shooting down the marines with his slingshot, and finally swimming to Sanji. Luffy and Zoro catch up. Luffy then uses his Gomu Gomu Rocket to propel Sanji, Usopp, and Zoro to the Going Merry.\nSmoker, Tashigi, Buggy and Alvida decide to chase them to the Grand Line as they gather up in different teams. The Straw Hat crew is ecstatic to go to the Grand Line as they all make their vows before setting sail.\n"
