  "short_summary": "Dorry, injured by the alcohol that exploded inside him, blames the Straw Hat Pirates. Luffy states that none of his crewmates nor Brogy did it, and he is enraged that someone would pull such a dirty trick to sabotage the giants' honorable duel.\n",
  "long_summary": "Usopp, who is immensely impressed with the giants' fight, decides to strive to be like them and starts calling Brogy, Master. After their fight, which, like thousands before it, ends in a draw, Dorry receives two barrels of alcohol from Brogy, which he obtained from Nami and Usopp. When Dorry later drinks it and it badly injures him from within, he accuses the Straw Hats. Left with no choice, Luffy fights the weakened giant and knocks him out. Unbeknownst to the crew and giants, the contents of one of the barrels has been rigged to explode. However, by the time of the next eruption of the center volcano, Dorry gets back up and heads into battle, knowing his chances to be low.\n"
