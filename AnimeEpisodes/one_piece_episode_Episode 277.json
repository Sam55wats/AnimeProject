  "title": "Tragedy of Ohara! Fear of Buster Call!",
  "short_summary": "Clover reveals that the Poneglyphs were most likely carved by an ancient country in order to prevent their enemy, the World Government, from completely erasing their history, but is shot by Spandine, who then activates the Golden Den Den Mushi. Robin recognizes Olvia as her mother, but Olvia denies it, causing Robin to admit that she is an archaeologist and can read the Poneglyphs. The Buster Call commences, and, after a tearful reunion with her daughter, Olvia entrusts Saul with Robin's care.\n",
  "long_summary": "Professor Clover is allowed to speak with one of the Five Elders and does a report of their research. He describes a civilization that existed hundreds of years ago and vanished at the time that the World Government assumed power. He considers the collective evidence, which leads him to believe that the government tried to erase their former enemies from history. After stating that Ohara has learned too much, the Five Elders orders Spandine to kill the professor and to give the order to destroy the island. Suddenly, the library is set aflame; while the scholars try to save the books, Robin admits to being an archeologist and unites with her mother. However, their reunion does not last long. Around them, cannon shots from the Buster Call's battleships start to hail down and Olvia sends her daughter off with Saul to flee the island, while she joins the effort to save the library's knowledge.\n"
