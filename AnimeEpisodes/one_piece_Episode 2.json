  "short_summary": "Luffy and Koby find Zoro captured in Shells Town's Marine base, with the Marines intending to execute him. Luffy and Koby work together to retrieve Zoro's katanas, as well as confront the tyrannical Marine Captain Morgan and his son Helmeppo.\n",
  "long_summary": "Luffy and Koby arrive at Shells Town, a town where a Marine base is stationed. They find their target, Roronoa Zoro, crucified at the base. A small girl, Rika, sneaks into the base to offer Zoro onigiri, but she is stopped by Helmeppo, a snobbish man who destroys the onigiri. However, Zoro later eats the dirt-stained rice.\nOutside the Marine base, Rika reveals that the town was run by a tyrannical Captain Morgan, who allowed his son, Helmeppo, to regularly abuse his citizens. One day, Helmeppo brought a hostile wolf into a bar which attacked the customers and ate their food. When Zoro attacked Helmeppo for his cruelty, Helmeppo threatened to execute all customers in the bar unless Zoro turned himself into the Marines, where he would be crucified for one month.\nLater, Helmeppo reveals that he intended to execute Zoro, violating the deal he had struck with him. Luffy assaults him for his dishonesty, then heads towards the Marine base to locate Zoro's confiscated katanas. As Morgan orders his men to erect a large statue of himself on the base's rooftop, Luffy launches himself towards the rooftop, accidentally destroying the statue in the process. Luffy grabs Helmeppo and flees, searching the building and locating the katanas. Meanwhile, the girl who robbed the Alvida Pirates' ship also infiltrates the Marine base to steal its goods.\nMeanwhile, Koby attempts to free Zoro from the cross, but is spotted by Morgan, who orders his men to open fire on them both. They are stopped by Luffy, who deflects the bullets with his rubber body.\n",
