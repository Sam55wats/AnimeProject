  "long_summary": "After escaping from G-8 the Straw Hat Pirates land in the sea softly and continue their voyage. In Mock Town, Donquixote Doflamingo perches from a column and uses his powers on Bellamy and Sarquiss as punishment for being defeated by Luffy prior to his journey to Skypiea. Bellamy begs Doflamingo to give him another chance, but Doflamingo concludes that Bellamy and his crew are obsolete to him and uses his puppetry to force Sarquiss to slash Bellamy, although he survives. In the seas the Straw Hats notice a ship lacking its sails without its captain or navigator. The ship then sails into a giant wave which destroys the ship. The crew then come across Long Ring Long Land, however it is too plain for their (particularly Sanji's) tastes. Luffy, Usopp and Chopper immediately de-board and start to act childish as usual and explore the island. The trio see long animals and come across two tall bamboos whose top couldn't be seen. Suddenly the bamboos start moving and one hits Luffy. Luffy gets excited and breaks the bamboo. Then falls an old man named Tonjit who has a horse named Shelly. Tonjit says that he made the world's tallest stilts and after going up, he couldn't come down for 10 years due to fear. Tonjit explains that due to expanse grassland, everyone here is relaxed making them long. After roaming around Long Ring Long Land the damaged Going Merry is seized by another ship as its captain confronts the crew and challenges them to a Davy Back Fight.\n"
