Barely escaping, Nami manages to prepare and release her finishing blow in the form of a horizontal lightning bolt.\nFranky, who had followed Chopper in climbing up the walls of the Tower of Justice, arrives as she is about to retrieve Kalifa's key. A moment's discussion later, they conceive of a plan. They follow Chopper into the room where Zoro and Sogeking, still cuffed together, try to fight Kaku and Jabra. There, Franky uses his air pressure cannon to blast Chopper outside and into the sea, while Nami uses Kalifa's key to release Zoro and Sogeking from their shackles.\n"
