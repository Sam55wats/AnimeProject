  "long_summary": "Luffy survives Foxy's Face Bombs, to the shock of the commentator. So, Foxy sets up fake wooden replicas of him. Given the smoke, Luffy finds it difficult to distinguish the real Foxy from the rest. So, Luffy insults Foxy, making him bow down. Luffy can then attack him.\nFoxy uses a trapdoor that takes Luffy out of bounds into the ocean. However, Luffy manages to grab onto the ship and narrowly avoid falling into the ocean. Foxy then locks Luffy into a room, then rigs the outside floor with spikes; Luffy would break out the door but fall into the lethal spikes. However, Luffy instead uses a cannon to break down the door.\nFoxy locks himself in the nurse's office. He then disguises himself as a nurse. He manages to punch Luffy before fleeing further. His second disguise as a chef also allows him to attack Luffy with another Kyubi Rush. This move makes Luffy fly into another room.\nThis room has a machine called the Gorilla Puncher 13, a wall covered in burning boxing gloves. Furthermore, this area has a mirror that allows Foxy's Noro Noro Beam to reflect. So, Luffy breaks the mirror, then jumps up and punches Foxy. Foxy, in retaliation successfully attacks Luffy using the Gorilla Puncher.\nFoxy goes to the deck to celebrate his victory. However, Luffy manages to get up. Foxy hits Luffy with two more Kyubi Rushes, but Luffy gets up and says that he will protect his nakama even if it means death.\n"
