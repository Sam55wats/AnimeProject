In one final attempt, Arlong attempts his Shark on Tooth technique against Luffy, but Luffy uses Gomu Gomu no Ono to stomp down on Arlong's back, sending him crashing down through several floors before landing on the bottom floor, unconscious.

Nezumi vows retribution before fleeing.\nBack at Cocoyasi Village, Genzo, on behalf of the townspeople, apologizes to Nami for ostracizing her. Meanwhile, Nezumi returns to his headquarters, where he reports Luffy to the Marines and requests that a high bounty be issued in his name.\n"
