  "title": "Hard Turn to the Clouds! Find the Southbird!",
  "short_summary": "Cricket explains how the Straw Hat Pirates can ride a dangerous vertical current called the Knock Up Stream to get to Skypiea. However, they first have to catch a South Bird to point them towards the point where the stream will erupt from the ocean.\n",
  "long_summary": "Mont Blanc Cricket explains to the Straw Hat Pirates that the sudden night they witnessed earlier was the result of a dense cloud and that the location of Skypiea was directly above this cloud. Cricket then explains that in theory, a ship can ride on the Knock Up Stream to reach Skypiea. However, if they fail to find a place to land there, they will fall back to earth. According to Cricket's prediction, the next Knock-up Stream will occur the next day. The Straw Hat Pirates go back inside to eat. Meanwhile, the Bellamy Pirates approach Cricket's home for gold.\nCricket continues reading Noland's logbook. Noland writes that he heard a bell upon reaching Sky Island. Cricket then shows three bell-shaped gold ingots he found while diving, proving that there was civilization there and also a golden sculpture of a southbird. He then explains that the Straw Hat Pirates will need to capture a southbird from the forest, because they always face south, so the pirates can use the southbird as a sort of compass to navigate to the Knock Up Stream.\nSo, while Cricket, Masira and Shoujou make repairs and improvements to the Going Merry, the Straw Hat Pirates split up into groups and venture into the forest to find a southbird. Sanji, Usopp and Nami end up in an area full of tarantulas, while Zoro gets stuck in a quagmire and Luffy and Chopper manage to find a southbird but it drops a bee's nest near Luffy, causing several insects to chase them away.\nMeanwhile, the Bellamy Pirates reach Cricket's house and Masira and Shoujou are prepared to fight them.\n"
