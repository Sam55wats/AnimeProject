  "title": "An Unexpected Guest! Sanji's Food and Gin's Grace",
  "short_summary": "Sanji feeds a starving pirate named Gin. Luffy begins his job as a chore boy to pay for the damage he caused to the Baratie. While working, Luffy tries to convince Sanji to join his crew, to no avail.\n",
  "long_summary": "Baratie's patissier, Patty, denounces Sanji for his violent actions against Fullbody. Zeff also beats Luffy through the floor above, causing them to fall into the dining area below. While Zeff, Patty and Sanji continue to argue, Fullbody attempts to flee, but is informed by his crew that Don Krieg, the most feared pirate in East Blue, has escaped their custody despite being starved for days.\nOne of Krieg's officers, Gin, appears at the restaurant, requesting food. Patty refuses to feed him as Gin cannot pay for the food, beating him to the ground and throwing him outside. Sanji decides to generously feed Gin with a dish of seafood risotto, which he gratefully accepts. Watching from above, Luffy invites Sanji into his crew, but Sanji refuses the invitation, stating he had reasons to stay at the Baratie. Gin warns Luffy of the dangers that lie in the Grand Line.\nGin leaves on his ship to return to his captain. Luffy and Sanji return to work, where the former works as a chore boy, but his clumsiness destroys the kitchen. Patty orders him to become a waiter instead, sending him into the dining area to take orders. While Luffy tends to the crew's table, Sanji serenades Nami, which disgusts Zeff.\nMeanwhile, Gin returns to Krieg at their headquarters. Despite Sanji's generosity towards Gin, they decide to plan an invasion of Baratie.\n",
