Wyper is seen discussing the current event of Gan Fall appearing at Upper Yard with other warriors and the village head. Wyper tells them that as long as there is a God trying to rule over them, they would rebel. Raki tried reasoning with him that Gan Fall may not be an enemy in a sense however, Wyper rejected her reason saying it will only get in the way.\nPagaya is seen fixing the waver the Straw Hats brought and discussing with Conis about helping the Straw Hats escape. Meanwhile, the battle between Gan Fall and Shura continued and Gan Fall lost. Zoro, Nami, and Robin continue their exploration of the forest. The battle between Luffy and Satori continues. Luffy being chased by the Ball Dragon ran towards a tree and happened to come by the string Satori is using to control the ball dragon. Luffy snaps the string in two making Satori lose control over the ball dragon. Luffy brings the ball dragon towards Satori which ends in an explosion. Usopp upon leaving the battle field to search for the boat is able to find the exit out of the forest. Luffy finally catches up with Satori and wraps his arms and legs around him, Sanji tells Luffy not to let go. Sanji and Luffy together defeat Satori.\n",
