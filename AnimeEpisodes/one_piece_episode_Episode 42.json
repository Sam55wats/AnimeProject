  "title": "Bursting Out! Fish-Man Arlong, Fearsome Attack From The Sea!",
  "short_summary": "Arlong attacks Luffy with his various fish-man abilities, first using his infinitely-regrowing teeth, then his sharp nose, and finally his signature weapon, the Kiribachi.\n",
  "long_summary": "Arlong attacks Luffy, biting through a stone column with his teeth and crushing his swords. Stating his dependence for his crew members for support, Luffy punches Arlong in the face, destroying his teeth, but Arlong reveals he is able to regrow his teeth, with each new set of teeth being stronger than the last. He is then uses his removed sets of teeth as handheld weapons. Luffy then takes one of Arlong's sets of teeth and also uses it as his own weapon, placing it in his mouth.\nAs a second technique, Arlong uses Shark on Darts, where he dives underwater, then charges at Luffy intending to pierce him with his nose. Although he uses this attack against Luffy multiple times, Luffy is able to stop him in his trajectory using his rubber-like hands.\nHaving been sufficiently angered, Arlong, possessing an ability similar to Sea Kings, enters an enraged, stronger state. In this state, he retrieves his weapon, the Kiribachi, a saw-like zanbato with tooth-like blades. He slams Luffy through the base's wall and into the building. Discovering the cartography room where Nami drew her maps, Luffy declares Nami his own navigator.\n"
