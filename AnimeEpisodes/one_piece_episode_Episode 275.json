Studying in the world's greatest library, the Tree of Omniscience, in the hopes of being allowed to help the local archeologists in their forbidden research, Robin earns the rank of a scholar in archaeology at age eight. However, when she announces her intention to help, her request is denied because of her youth. Disappointed at being rejected again, she walks along the shore, where she stumbles on Jaguar D.
