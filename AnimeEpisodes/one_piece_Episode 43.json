  "title": "The End of the Fish-Man Empire! Nami is my Friend!",
  "short_summary": "Luffy finally defeats Arlong, whom he forces Nezumi to arrest. Luffy accepts Nami into his crew as his permanent navigator, and Nezumi issues a bounty on Luffy.\n",
  "long_summary": "Luffy notices Nami's old pen covered in her blood, revealing the abuse she endured as Arlong's cartographer. After Arlong boasts about using her for his own personal gain, Luffy breaks the Kiribachi's blades with his hands, then destroys the sea maps and furniture in the room. The spectators outside the base notice the furniture being thrown out of the building, which is also seen by Nami, who thanks Luffy for doing so.\nArlong angrily bites Luffy's shoulder, but Luffy manages to break Arlong's nose. In one final attempt, Arlong attempts his Shark on Tooth technique against Luffy, but Luffy uses Gomu Gomu no Ono to stomp down on Arlong's back, sending him crashing down through several floors before landing on the bottom floor, unconscious. The structural damage caused by Luffy's attack causes the building to collapse. Luffy emerges from the rubble and declares Nami to be his crew member, to which she accepts.\nThe spectators attempt to celebrate their liberation from Arlong, but are stopped by Nezumi's forces, who attempts to seize Arlong's wealth for himself. The crew angrily attack the Marines, ordering them to arrest Arlong and return his wealth to the townspeople. Nezumi vows retribution before fleeing.\nBack at Cocoyasi Village, Genzo, on behalf of the townspeople, apologizes to Nami for ostracizing her. Meanwhile, Nezumi returns to his headquarters, where he reports Luffy to the Marines and requests that a high bounty be issued in his name.\n",
