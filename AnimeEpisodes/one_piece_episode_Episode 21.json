Patty refuses to feed him as Gin cannot pay for the food, beating him to the ground and throwing him outside. Sanji decides to generously feed Gin with a dish of seafood risotto, which he gratefully accepts. Watching from above, Luffy invites Sanji into his crew, but Sanji refuses the invitation, stating he had reasons to stay at the Baratie.

While Luffy tends to the crew's table, Sanji serenades Nami, which disgusts Zeff.\nMeanwhile, Gin returns to Krieg at their headquarters. Despite Sanji's generosity towards Gin, they decide to plan an invasion of Baratie.\n"
