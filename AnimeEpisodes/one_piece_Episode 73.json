  "title": "Brogy Wails in Victory! Elbaf's Judgement",
  "short_summary": "Luffy tries in vain to convince the injured Dorry not to fight Brogy. The Officer Agents who sabotaged the alcohol further tamper with the giants' duel.\n",
  "long_summary": "Ignoring the fact that he's badly injured, Dorry puts a gigantic rock on top of Luffy to prevent him to interfere in his fight with Brogy. Then, the two giants meet and start to fight once again.\nZoro finds Nami in the middle of the forest, but he suspects that it's not all right; Nami finds Luffy but she's immediately attacked. Usopp, left alone in the forest, screams in panic and runs until he reaches Vivi and Luffy. Vivi suspects that Baroque Works is responsible for the disapparitions and for the sneak attack with the barrel.\nMr. 3 in fact has planned to make Brogy defeat Dorry and some minutes later it really happens. Brogy, not knowing the help received, bursts in tears, but Mr. 3 immediately blocks his legs with a strange substance. Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine reach Dorry's base bringing Karoo with them: they found him and hit him repeatedly. The two Officer Agents quickly defeat Usopp and Vivi.\n",
