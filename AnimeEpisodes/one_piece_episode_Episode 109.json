  "long_summary": "Chopper distracts Crocodile while Sanji frees the rest of the crew. Smoker reveals to the Straw Hats that Miss All Sunday is a wanted woman, and that the World Government has been chasing after her for 20 years, along with a bounty of 70 million - almost as much as Crocodile's. Sanji beats up a few Banana Gators to get the key to the cell. But instead of getting the key, the Straw Hats see Mr. 3 pop out of an aligator's stomach. Mr. 3 retrieves the key and then throws it in the middle of three Banana Gators. While Crocodile and Miss All Sunday are speaking Crocodile reveals that he had the real key to the cell all along. Usopp has an idea where they could use Mr. 3's Devil Fruit powers to get them out. By the time Crocodile and Miss All Sunday get back to the room, they see that the Straw Hats and Smoker have left the cell. After Luffy tells Zoro to save Smoker, he lets the Straw Hats off, while the rest of the Marines chase after them. The crew runs away while Luffy says that they are not going to stop running until they reach Alubarna.\n"
