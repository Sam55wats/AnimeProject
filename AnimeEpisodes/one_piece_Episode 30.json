Still, Sanji mentions his dream of locating the All Blue, a mythical ocean where all four seas meet. Zeff overhears this conversation between Sanji and Luffy.\nThe restaurant staff taste Sanji's soup, and Patty, Carne, and Zeff all pretend to dislike the soup to prompt Sanji to set sail with Luffy, and Sanji leaves the dining area in anger. Zeff reveals his true intentions to Luffy, and Sanji overhears this from outside the restaurant. He finally agrees to join the crew as their cook.\nA shark arrives at the Baratie with Yosaku in its mouth. He reports he was unable to follow Nami, but was able to estimate her rough destination, warning of its danger. So, the crew prepare for departure, with Luffy packing food from the kitchen and Sanji preparing to move out. Sanji walks out the Baratie in front of the kitchen staff, prostrating in front of Zeff and thanking him for his sacrifices.\nMeanwhile, the Going Merry nears its destination, an island ruled by a fearsome pirate crew.\n",
