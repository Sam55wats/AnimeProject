Usopp believes that Luffy has abandoned the dignity of their ship and says he is leaving the crew. He then challenges Luffy to a duel for the Going Merry.\n",
  "long_summary": "The episode begins with Usopp waking up after he was beaten unconsious by the Franky Family. It is also noted that Nico Robin has not yet returned to the ship.\nHe is informed by Luffy that the stolen money probably can not be retrieved and that the crew has decided to buy a new ship instead of repairing the Going Merry. Usopp is enraged by this, which prompts Luffy to clarify that it is impossible to repair the Merry with the damage she has sustained. Usopp refuses to accept this and thinks that Luffy has abandoned the Merry. The two get into a fight which eventually prompts Usopp to leave the crew. This was not only due to the current situation, but a culmination of Usopp's insecurity that he was too weak to be a part of the Straw Hat Pirates. This ends with Usopp challenging Luffy to a duel for the rights to the Merry.\nLater that night, Nami tries to dissuade Luffy from fighting with Usopp. This is unsuccessful and Luffy still wishes to fight Usopp. Chopper tries to heal Usopp, but he also refuses. Later, Usopp and Luffy meet for the fight.\n"
