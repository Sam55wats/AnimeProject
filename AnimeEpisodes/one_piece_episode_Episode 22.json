Against the wishes of Patty and all the other staff, Sanji agrees to feed him, giving Krieg a bowl of rice. Krieg hungrily eats the food, but staying true to his reputation, once he finishes his food, he betrays the Baratie, launching an invasion. Having a damaged ship and a hundred starving subordinates, he demands the staff to feed all of his crew members, then vacate the Baratie so he could take the ship for himself.\nSanji attempts to comply with Krieg's demands, but the other staff restrain him, refusing to give up the ship.

In response, gun barrels emerge from the armour, and he opens fire at the kitchen staff. At this point, Zeff decides to submit to Krieg, giving him food for his crew members.\n"
