He tried his new weapon which was only partially functional and he wasn't able to disconnect the rope. Sanji, seeing Luffy and Usopp became upset and comically gave both of them beatings. Sanji told Usopp and Luffy that they need to temporarily forget about the boat and join forces in defeating Satori. Satori on hearing this, used impact to attack Sanji.\nAisa is seen running across Upper Yard and went into an opening in one of trees and was seen gathering soil. On hearing the footsteps of people, the girl went into hiding. Chopper is shown trying to retrieve the hammer he had dropped after hitting it against his fingers. On retrieving the hammer, a skyshark charged towards him, attempting to devour him and Chopper somehow landed on the shark and was thrown back to the ship, landing right in front of the One Whistle they received from Gan Fall.\nChopper decided to use the whistle, but only as his last resort. Just then Priest Shura arrives, questioning why Chopper is the only sacrifice he has to kill. After that moment, Chopper blew into the whistle. Satori continued to fight Luffy and Usopp after Sanji passed out from Satori's last attack, and he completely overwhelmed the three of them.\n"
