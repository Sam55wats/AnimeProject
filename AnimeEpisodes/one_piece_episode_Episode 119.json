  "long_summary": "Roronoa Zoro is struggling in his fight against Mr. 1 due to his inability to cut through steel. After a prolonged battle where Zoro displays a wide variety of techniques against the assassin, he thinks back back to when his old mentor said that a swordsman who can cut nothing can cut anything including steel. Still not understanding this idea, he is forced onto the defensive from Mr. 1's attacks which climax with the latter creating multiple spinning blades on his arms, landing a direct hit on the swordsman. Unable to defend against it, Zoro falls against a pillar and Mr. 1 delivers what he believes is the final blow that further wounds Zoro and destroys the pillar he was leaning on, causing the pillar and arch fall on top of him.\nMr. 1 begins to walk away but quickly notices that Zoro has gotten up once again. Wondering out loud how Zoro was able to dodge all the flying debris, the swordsman claims that he did not dodge it all, and that he just was able to sense where no debris was falling and went there. Further elaborating to himself, Zoro notes that he can sense the rhythm of all things around him and can tell where his sword is, turning over a stone to find it. Picking it up, he then turns and slashes at some leaves on a tree without cutting them before then cutting a rock clean in half. Finally coming to an understanding of his teacher's words, he then attacks Mr. 1 with only one sword. Zoro then proves he is finally able to cut Mr. 1 and defeats him, collapsing to the ground and wonders if everyone else is okay.\n"
