  "short_summary": "The Going Merry is grounded during a period of low tide and Jonathan believes they\u2019ve reached \"checkmate\". They cleverly use the Impact Dial to boost the ship and the Breath and Flame Dials to inflate the Octopus Balloon again so they can escape.\n",
  "long_summary": "Lieutenant Commander Jonathan puts into action his \"9 o'clock\" trap; during 9 o'clock, the base can use periods of low tide to prevent the ships from escaping. So, when Luffy commands the ship to go full speed ahead, a hole was torn in the hull by the rocks on the harbor floor. \nThe harbor eventually reaches a very low tide, rendering the ship unable to move. Jonathan gloats via megaphone how he had captured the Straw Hat Pirates.\nSo, the Straw Hat Pirates launch their plan; they use Usopp's Impact Dial to launch the ship into the air, then uses an Octopus Balloon inflated with Breath and Flame Dials to float in the air. Jonathan orders his men to fire a \"warning shot\" at the balloon. However, Shepherd also aims for the balloon with his bazooka, only to instead miss and shoot down the Marines' cannon.\nJonathan accepts that the Straw Hat Pirates have won, and that they have successfully escaped G-8. He commands Drake to ceasefire. Shepherd, who is angry that the Straw Hats escaped, threatens to have G-8 decommissioned, but is punched by Jessica. Jonathan explains that the pirate encounter was a bonding experience for the Marines, so he is not upset that the pirates escaped.\nMeanwhile, the Straw Hats are seen flying towards the sunset. Usopp works on fixing the hole.\n"
