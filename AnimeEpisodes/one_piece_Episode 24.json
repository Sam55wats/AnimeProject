  "title": "Hawk-Eyes Mihawk! Swordsman Zoro Falls into the Sea!",
  "short_summary": "Zoro battles the world-famous Dracule Mihawk and faces defeat. Mihawk then leaves, allowing Krieg to begin his invasion against the Baratie.\n",
  "long_summary": "Yosaku explains how he and Johnny lost the Going Merry. While their backs were turned to her, Nami pushed them both overboard. Stating she needed to take care of \"business,\" she drove the ship away, leaving the crew behind. Almost immediately after Johnny and Yosaku fell into the sea, they witnessed the Krieg Pirates' flagship be destroyed.\nZoro recognizes the assailant as Dracule \"Hawk-Eyes\" Mihawk, rumoured to be the world's greatest swordsman. Mihawk states that he attacked the Krieg Pirates simply for his own amusement. Zoro immediately challenges him to a duel, to which he accepts. However, seeing Zoro as comparatively weaker than him, he uses a kogatana. They begin battle.\nDespite wielding three katana, Zoro is unable to land a single attack on Mihawk, who blocks each of his attacks with his kogatana. Eventually, he manages to wound Zoro, piercing him in the chest. Seeing Zoro's strong will, Mihawk agrees to use his Meito, Yoru, against Zoro. With this weapon, Mihawk destroys two of Zoro's katana, leaving only Zoro's Wado Ichimonji unharmed and further wounding him. In defeat, Zoro allows Mihawk to slash him across the chest, knocking him unconscious.\nMihawk deliberately let Zoro live, telling him to become stronger so Zoro may eventually surpass him. Zoro agrees, vowing to never lose another battle before defeating Mihawk. Satisfied with the duel, Mihawk decides not to pursue Krieg, leaving. With all interruptions gone, Krieg is now able to attack the Baratie. Luffy orders Usopp and Zoro to pursue Nami while he faces Krieg on his own. Zeff agrees to nullify Luffy's debts if he repels the invasion.\n",
