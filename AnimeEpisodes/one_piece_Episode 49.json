Luffy attempts to fight Smoker, but his attack misses and he accidentally launches himself into the air and far away from the platform. There, he finds the Buggy Pirates in disguise in search of him. After being spotted, Luffy runs back to the execution platform.\nMeanwhile, Tashigi forces Zoro to work as a janitor at the Marine base to pay for the glasses he broke. However, he is recognized by two other Marines as one of Luffy's crew members. Zoro attacks the Marines, takes their money and flees.\nZoro goes to the sword shop to purchase two swords, where he meets Tashigi again. After picking the supposedly-cursed Sandai Kitetsu, he decides to test his luck by throwing the blade into the air and extending his arm in the sword's way. The sword circles neatly around his arm, leaving him unharmed. Impressed with his skill and luck, the store owner decides to give him the Sandai Kitetsu as well as the Yubashiri free of charge.\nTashigi reports back to the Marine base, where she is informed that Zoro attacked two Marines.\n",
