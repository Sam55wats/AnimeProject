  "short_summary": "Severely beaten and bruised, Usopp and Chopper finally manage to defeat Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas. Meanwhile, Mr. 2 Bon Kurei has figured out Sanji's weakness (women).\n",
  "long_summary": "Miss Merry Christmas has informed Usopp that Luffy is dead. While she and Mr. 4 are glad that Luffy is gone, Usopp refuses to accept it. The mole-like woman swings Usopp along the ground and Mr. 4 takes his hit. Even so, Usopp is still standing and believes Luffy is still alive.\nBefore Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas continue, Usopp obstructs their vision with smoke, then Chopper tricks Mr. 4 into hitting his partner. Usopp then slingshots a hammer right into the giant Baroque Works agent from Chopper's horns. One of Mr. 4's baseball's then puts the Baroque Works pair out.\nIn the city, the fighting worsens and Koza is feeling unfazed by the bullet he took in Nanohana. He then plans to force Cobra to surrender. Vivi races to warn her father but if she can't reach him, wishes to speak with Chaka.\nMeanwhile, Mr. 2 is fighting Sanji in the streets. He then attempts to distract Sanji with a swan ballet. Much of their attacks barely affect one-another. Bon Clay uses his Clone-Clone powers to rearrange his own face. But Sanji dislikes it. He then tries to use Usopp's face, but the cook doesn't fall for it. Bon Clay believes his soul is refined. He then shifts his face into Nami's rapidly which catches Sanji's attention.\nVivi arrives at the palace to stop Chaka's fighting. She then wants the palace destroyed. Chaka shakes for a moment, but then accepts her orders.\n",
