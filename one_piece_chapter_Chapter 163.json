Vivi, in shock, realizes who he is and starts to remember their first encounter.\nEleven years ago, a young kid named Koza asked King Cobra to stop the drought in his village because the villagers were suffering. When Cobra told him it is out of his power, Koza's father, Toto appeared, ashamed by his son's rudeness and begs the king to forgive them. Koza, being too proud to beg the king for forgiveness, rushed out of the room.

This is the start of a fight between the two kids, which rapidly transformed into a friendship. Vivi became the sub-leader of the Suna Suna Clan, just under Koza.
