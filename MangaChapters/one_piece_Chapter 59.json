  "long_summary": "Sanji continues to let Pearl assault him as he has decided to die rather than let the Baratie be taken by the Krieg Pirates. Luffy becomes angry as he does not understand how Sanji's death would repay Zeff's sacrifice. To put an end to Sanji's suicide, he destroys the Baratie since it is the target of Don Krieg. While Sanji and Luffy fighting about the best solution to save Zeff, Pearl decides to attack them. However, he is stopped by Gin, who defeats him with one blow. He proclaims he will take care of Sanji's death, personally.\n\n",
