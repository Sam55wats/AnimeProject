  "title": "Sabagashira No. 1",
  "short_summary": "Don Krieg orders his crew to attack Baratie so that he may take it for himself. Luffy makes a deal with Zeff to get out of his servitude as a waiter for a year. Luffy starts fighting against Krieg and his crew. The cooks of the Baratie prepare for combat and Sanji shows his proficiency in kicking for the first time.\n",
  "long_summary": "Don Krieg decides to steal the Baratie, saying that it will make a perfect ship for the Grand Line, since no one would suspect it to be a pirate ship and when one of his crew speaks out about going back, he kills him. Krieg also mentions his plans to read Zeff's logbook to better prepare his crew for the grand line. This inspires the Krieg Pirates, and they start to attack the Baratie, to which Luffy responds by attacking them and defending the Baratie as per his agreement with Zeff.\nHowever, the chefs are ready to fight, they release a wood platform in front of the restaurant, so that they do not have to fight into the restaurant and damage it, and Patty and Carne show off the Sabagashira No. 1 which is the fish head of the Baratie, and a paddle boat, which they use to attack Krieg. However, Don Krieg manages to subdue it easily and throw it back toward the chefs, but Sanji kicks it back just as easily showing his true strength.\n\n"
