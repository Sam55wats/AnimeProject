She even showed that\u00a0she could\u00a0earn all the money she wanted. Disgusted by this selfish behavior, the villagers rejected her. But when Nojiko went to her mother's grave, Nami was already sitting there. She explained to her sister that in order to accomplish their mother's last wish and live, they could not rebel against Arlong who was too strong for them. Instead she decided to draw maps for him, revealing that she would be able to buy her village back for 100,000,000.\n\n"
