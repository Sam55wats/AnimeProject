Before approaching, they prepare a countermeasure against Mr. 2's power by wearing a sign of friendship on their arm. In the port of Nanohana in Arabasta, a group of people are intrigued by an unconscious guy in a restaurant. This strange guy who fell asleep while eating is no other than Portgas D. Ace, Whitebeard's second division commander. This is revealed by an old adversary: Smoker, who also appears to be in town in the search for the Straw Hat Pirates. Ace is looking for his little brother.\n\n",
