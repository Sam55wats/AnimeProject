  "long_summary": "When Pearl receives the first bloody nose of his life, he enters a berserk rage and sets his armor on fire by punching the pearls on it. Many of the chefs become frightened and warn him that he will set the entire ship on fire. However, as a cook, Sanji warns the other chefs they should not be afraid of fire as he leaps over the firewall Pearl has created.\nSanji continues to battle Pearl with his superior speed and kicking abilities. He tells them that a chef's tools include his hands so he only uses his feet when fighting. Pearl becomes increasingly upset as he is trashed by Sanji.\nIn order to stop him from destroying the ship, Don Krieg throws a knob toward Sanji and Pearl. Luffy is able to deflect it with his Gum Gum Bazooka. The knob instead destroys Don Krieg's ship mast which falls over and subsequently renders Pearl unconscious.\nHowever, the Krieg Pirates have not said their last word. While they were fighting, Gin has taken Zeff down and threatens to take his life as he holds a gun to his head.\n\n"
