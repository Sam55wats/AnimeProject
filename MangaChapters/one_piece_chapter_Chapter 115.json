  "long_summary": "Vivi begins to appreciate life on board the Going Merry and the carefree lifestyle of her new friends. She has reservations as she constantly warns them to not underestimate the dangers that await them on the Grand Line.\nAfter a calm journey, they finally arrive at Little Garden, about which Miss All Sunday had warned them. It appears to be a weird tropical forest and is inhabited by even stranger animals. Nami is not eager to leave the boat as their Log Pose resets but the rest of the crew has an opposing opinion. Luffy craves adventure and decides to set out to explore. Much to Nami's surprise, Vivi decides to accompany Luffy in order to be distracted from her worries. She drags along a not-so-willing Karoo.\nAfter they depart, Sanji asks Zoro to go on a hunt in order to retrieve more food as they are running low. Zoro, who is not so pleased to work on Sanji's orders, replies with a nasty comment that he would get something bigger than Sanji anyways. Sanji refuses to lose face in front of Nami and challenges Zoro to a hunt contest\u2014to see who can bring back the largest weight in food for the crew.\nLuffy and Vivi discover weird animals and they realize Little Garden is, in fact, a prehistoric island which has stayed evolutionary-wise at the dinosaur era.\nMeanwhile back at the boat, Nami and Usopp are alone and not confident aboard the Going Merry. Nami finds a book which explains the island's name. Suddenly a giant shadow approaches them.\n\n"
