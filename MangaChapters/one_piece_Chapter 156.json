  "long_summary": "Five days after leaving Drum Island, the stock of food is shrinking. While crossing a smoke steam made by undersea volcanoes, Luffy and Usopp find an okama dressed like a swan. After saving him from drowning, he reveals that he ate a Devil Fruit. Making a show with his ability to imitate anybody he touches, the Okama strikes up an immediate friendship with the trio of Usopp, Chopper and Luffy. However, their encounter is cut short when the Okama's crew arrives to retrieve their captain. Leaving the Merry, he makes a promise of eternal friendship but, as his men greet him, his name is revealed to be Mr. 2 Bon Kurei. Understanding that they have met with an enemy, now able to usurp their identity, the Straw Hats decide to take countermeasure.\n\n",
