The island seems to be in an important time of its history since strange things are hinted: it has no name, the villagers are making a police force, and an election is about to occur. But to the Straw Hats' misfortune, there is only one doctor\u2014a 140 year old lady, Dr. Kureha\u2014whom the villagers call a witch.
