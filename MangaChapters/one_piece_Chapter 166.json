  "short_summary": "Crocodile discovers that the Straw Hat Pirates are still alive, but thanks to Mr. 2, he is able to take countermeasures so that Vivi and the rebels would not be able to meet each other. Meanwhile Vivi and Luffy start to dispute each other.\n",
  "long_summary": "An old face interrupts Baroque Works meeting. It is no other than Mr. 3, who snuck in after the other members from Spiders Cafe. He came to be given another chance to defeat the Straw Hats. Crocodile is surprised by this revelation since, after the call from Little Garden, he assumed all of the Straw Hat Pirates and Vivi were dead as he was not aware that it was Sanji who answered the call and lied to him. Mr. 2 confirms that the Straw Hat Pirates and Vivi are alive since he met them on the way to Arabasta. With the help of his power, they are able to make pictures of the Straw Hats (omitting Sanji), and start to take counter measures so that they can prevent Vivi from meeting with the rebel leader, Koza. Disappointed with Mr. 3, instead of giving him a second chance, Crocodile dries him up and feeds him to his Bananawani.\nMeanwhile, Luffy and Vivi's argument is intensifying. Luffy finds her na\u00efve in wishing for no one to die. Upset, Vivi and Luffy start a fight until Luffy reveals his true intention: he wants Vivi to risk the life of her friends with her so that he can beat Crocodile, who is responsible for this situation.\n\n",
