Making a show with his ability to imitate anybody he touches, the Okama strikes up an immediate friendship with the trio of Usopp, Chopper and Luffy. However, their encounter is cut short when the Okama's crew arrives to retrieve their captain. Leaving the Merry, he makes a promise of eternal friendship but, as his men greet him, his name is revealed to be Mr. 2 Bon Kurei.
