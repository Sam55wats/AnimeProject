He has located Nami but can do nothing without Luffy's strength.\nWhile he is ok to depart, Sanji, to the surprise of every one, decides to go with them and becomes the Straw Hat Chef. He changed his mind when he heard that everybody wanted him to depart. As to comfort his decision, Zeff tells him that he regrets to have let him live.\nA nostalgic Zeff is seen remembering his restaurant history. When it is time for departure, everybody becomes serious. Patty and Carne even try an ultimate revenge attack on Sanji but it proves useless as he easily beats the two back.
