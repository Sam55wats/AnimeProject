  "title": "The Kingdom's Strongest Warrior",
  "short_summary": "Making a ruckus into the casino, Luffy, Usopp, Zoro and Nami are invited to a V.I.P. room by Crocodile. Chased by Smoker, they end up into a cell. Smoker reveals to them that the cell they are shut into is made of Seastone, a material that has the power to drain Devil Fruit powers like the sea does. Then, a sarcastic Crocodile shows himself mocking their helplessness. However, he is waiting for Vivi and has sent Miss All Sunday to get her back.\n",
  "long_summary": "Luffy noisily enters the casino and demands that Crocodile show himself which disturbs a lot of the people in there. Smoker then runs into the casino as well. While Luffy takes care of the security, the Straw Hats are then escorted to the V.I.P room but this turns out to be a ruse as they fall into a trap. The trapped members of the Straw Hats then start fighting along with Smoker who explains that the prison is made of sea stone, an item that is basically a solid form of the sea which hampers devil fruit power. Crocodile then appears to the prisoners, saying that he is awaiting Vivi and has sent for Miss All Sunday to pick her up. Meanwhile, Vivi is fighting several members of Baroque Works. When Pell arrives and defeats the Baroque Works members, he is then confronted by Miss All Sunday.\n\n"
